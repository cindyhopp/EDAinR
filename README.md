## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) practice

This repository hosts my practice work on exploratory data analysis in R environment.

#### 1. [ABMI Water Physiochemistry Properties](https://github.com/cindyhopp/EDAinR/tree/main/ABMI_water_physiochemistry_EDA)
Utilizing Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Instituteâ€™s Wetland Habitat Water Physiochemistry dataset, a series of data wrangling and exploratory data analysis was conducted in R to examine and visualize relationships among different physiochemical properties of water samples.

#### 2. [Statistics Canada Labor Force Survey](https://github.com/cindyhopp/EDAinR/tree/main/StatsCan_labor_force_survey)
A complete data analytics workflow in R from data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, modeling to result dissemination was completed to uncover insights and trends of current state of the labor market in Canada.
