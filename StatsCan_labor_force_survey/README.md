This was the final group project as part of the Fundamentals of Spatial Data Analytics course. A complete data analytics workflow in R from data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, modeling to result dissemination was completed to uncover insights and trends of current state of the labor market in Canada.
My role included assembling data, conducting cross-variable data exploration, building predictive models, result evaluation, report writing, and group task management.
